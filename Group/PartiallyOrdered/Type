{- This is the weakest form of order provided. There is no standalone preorder,
   partial order, or anything, because there are too many possible
   instances. For the general case, just define regular functions. A
   `Group/PartiallyOrdered` constrains the instances enough for a generic “less
   than” to be meaningful.
