{- The currying isomorphism is defined for any closed monoidal (semigroupal?)
   category (semigroupoid?), based on the – ⊗ X ⊣ Hom(X, –) odjunction.

   FIXME: Because closed categories are self-enriched and `Isomorphism`
          currently has to be enriched by a category where the objects are
          types, this is currently restricted to categories where the objects
          are types.
