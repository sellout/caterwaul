{- NB: This is defined in terms of the monoidal categories instead of the other
       way around because this is more restrictive than either monoidal
       category.
     • Applicative requires that the target category is **Set** and
     • monadic requires an endofunctor`object`.
       When you combine these two restrictions, you end up only being able to
       support endofunctors in **Set**.
